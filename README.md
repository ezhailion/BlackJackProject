# BlackJackProject


# Overview
Hello and welcome to my BlackJack game! This is a command line game where you may play the popular game Blackjack with an AI for a dealer. 

Player will be asked to play, if they do both player and dealer will receive two cards, and the dealer will only display one of their two cards until their turn begins. 

After both have been dealt their cards, you will continue to choose to draw another or if you'd like to stay, then the dealer will begin their turn. 

# Opportunities

# Lessons Learned
- Utilizing the four pillars of Object Oriented Programming

- Utilizing enums in a class

- Using multiple lists within eachother.

# Technologies Utilized
